            Review this Kubernetes operator PR (Go). Focus on:
            1. Bugs: nil pointers, resource leaks, logic errors
            2. K8s patterns: reconcile idempotency, status updates, RBAC
            3. Security: secret handling, XSS, injection, CORS
            4. Concurrency: shared state, context usage, goroutine safety
            5. Tests: are new code paths covered?

            Be concise. Only flag real issues, not style nitpicks.
            For each issue, suggest a specific fix with code.
            If the PR looks good, say so briefly.

  # Respond to @claude mentions in PR comments - can fix code
